Project 3 Requirements/Stories/Notes:

(feel free to add/modify/delete as you see fit)

What is it: Classroom Management System- for Kindergarten level classes. 
Users: Teachers/Principal, parents
Problem addressed: Universal class management systems are generally tailored towards
	older students. Students/parents would benefit more from a more specific
	target-audience based application.
How is it specific towards Kindergarten level classes, and not just like Blackboard:
	 For parents, not students. Kindergarten themed. The events/uploads/pics are
	 generally tailored towards younger school-classes. Good/bad behavior.
	 (field trips- (joke) student forgets to bring home sheet and they can't go).

* Pictures/class hardcoded in are based off Kindergarten Cop movie.

* Fun based- maybe blog-style layout?

* As a teacher, I can:
	-Log in/out
	-Register student (not needed)
	-Soft delete student (if time- not important)
	-Record/view grades for students
	-Schedule meetings with parents
	-Reschedule/delete meetings
	-Approve/deny meetings from parents
	-View meetings table (shows pending/approved/denied status)
	-Create & manage events
	-Send emails to single parent
	-Send email to all parents
	-Uploading photos (class/field-trip photos)
	-Good/bad behavior. 
	-Give students special merit badges on their account area: like boyscout
	 badges with custom icons. "3-week spelling Test 100%", "teacher assistant
	 for a day", "neat handwriting", "best napper", etc.
	
* As a parent, I can:

	-Schedule meetings with teacher
	--View meetings table (shows pending/approved/denied status)
	-Approve/deny meetings from teacher
